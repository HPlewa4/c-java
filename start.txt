✅ 2️⃣ (Optional) Recompile the native C++ library

If you haven’t built libbridge.so yet (or recently edited bridge.cpp), run this:

g++ -fPIC -shared bridge.cpp -o libbridge.so \
    -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/include \
    -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/include/linux


That ensures your .so (shared object) is up to date.

✅ 3️⃣ (Optional) Recompile Java (only if changed)

If you changed your Java code, do:

javac Bridge.java

✅ 4️⃣ Run the program

Now execute:

java -Djava.library.path=. Bridge


👉 Explanation:

-Djava.library.path=. tells Java to look in the current folder for your native .so file.

Bridge is your main Java class.
